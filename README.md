❤️ Double-Click Heart Animation
This is a simple yet visually appealing double-click heart animation created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When the user double-clicks on the image, a heart icon appears and then fades away with a smooth animation. This effect mimics the popular "like" interaction seen on social media platforms like Instagram.
